# Welcome to my GitHub! 

I'm a junior at Boston University majoring in Business Administration with a double concentration in Business Analytics and MIS. I have previous marketing experiences, serving as an account manager at Guerrilla Marketing Society and as a marketing specialist at Data 4 Good. This summer, I was also a Marketing Operations Intern at City National Bank.

I recently discovered a passion for data and the tremendous impact it has on our lives. Through personal projects, I will be documenting my data journey here as I learn more about this field. I hope to combine the business acumen I gain through marketing experiences with the technical skills I learn to help my community in the future. 

For now, my goal is to land a Data Analyst/Business Analyst internship for Summer 2021.

## [Spotify Playlist Data Exploration](https://github.com/winst0n-w/spotify-analysis/blob/master/Spotify%20Playlists%20Data%20Exploration.ipynb)

I listen to music probably all the time and one thing I always look forward to is Spotify's year-end summary and seeing that year's stats and my favorite artists and tracks.


I discovered that you can use Spotify's API to extract information about your Spotify profile. To build upon the Python skills I learned in school, I decided to use the Python library, Spotipy, to write a script to extract information on some of my playlists and its tracks. Along with the tracks, I also analyzed the track features that Spotify offers such as danceability, energy, valence, etc. 

Some questions I wanted to answer were:

* Who are my favorite artists?

* What type of music do I listen to? (in terms of the different features Spotify has)

* How does my music taste change over time?

* How do my playlists differ from each other?
