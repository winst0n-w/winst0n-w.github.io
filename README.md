# Welcome! 

I'm a junior at Boston University, majoring in Business Administration with a double concentration in Business Analytics and MIS. I have previous marketing experiences, serving as an account manager at Guerrilla Marketing Society and as a marketing specialist at Data 4 Good. This summer, I was also a Marketing Operations Intern at City National Bank.

I recently discovered a passion for data and the potential it has to improve our lives. I hope to combine my business acumen and technical skills to land a data scientist role in the future. For now, my goal is to land a Data Analyst/Business Analyst internship for Summer 2021.

## [NBA 2K Ratings Prediction](https://github.com/winst0n-w/2k-rating/blob/master/2K%20Ratings.ipynb)
After going down a YouTube rabbit hole and watching a compilation of NBA players complain about their 2K ratings, I started wondering what 2K takes into account when they decide those ratings. I wanted to see if I can try predicting the ratings using a few of the more common statistics such as points, assists, and rebounds with regression models in Python. 

I wrote a Python script to scrape 2K ratings from hoopshype.com and downloaded stats of every NBA player in the past 7 seasons from basketball-reference.com to form the dataset I used in this project.

## [Spotify Playlist Data Exploration](https://github.com/winst0n-w/spotify-analysis/blob/master/Spotify%20Playlists%20Data%20Exploration.ipynb)

I listen to music all the time and one thing I always look forward to is Spotify's year-end summary and seeing that year's stats and my favorite artists and tracks.


I discovered that you can use Spotify's API to extract information about your Spotify profile. To build upon the Python skills I learned in school, I decided to use the Python library, Spotipy, to write a script to extract information on some of my playlists and its tracks. Along with the tracks, I also analyzed the track features that Spotify offers such as danceability, energy, valence, etc. 

Some questions I wanted to answer were:

* Who are my favorite artists?
* What type of music do I listen to? (in terms of the different features Spotify has)
* How does my music taste change over time?
* How do my playlists differ from each other?
